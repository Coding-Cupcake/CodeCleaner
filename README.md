# CodeCleaner
Python script for formatting copied code such that it can be used further.

When dealing with testing other's code you often have to copy such code out of e.g. pdf files. If such files contain also the code line numbers, you have to remove them manually one by one, which can be really tedious. CodeCleaner detects line numbers, removes them and writes the output in a new file, which you can use further for your testing purposes.
